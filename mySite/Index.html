           Iam Raja Reddy persuing my Btech at NIT Warangal in Computer Science
        I adapt quickly and I like things very fastly.
        I like applying the skills I learn.
        I more of result oriented guy.
        starting from my childhood, I was just an above average guy, until it comes to some competition.
        In my 5thss I cracked JNVST->simply I was in the top 40 of 12000 students. when I was in 10th, I was just a 9 pointer while my 27 friends got 10 points.
        in my 12th I was in above 4000 in more than 9 lakhs.

        I like many things and achived somthing in those in in technical side- Coding (coded Btree), 
        Machine learning(Made a model to recognise faces. as per the pandemic everyone is wearing a mask, so I adjusted my model to just take the uncovered data), 
        Designing DBs(I designed a Restaurant management database)
        I got 100% scholarship in my seniors FullStack development program so, Im gonna do it coming days.
        in non technical side, Yoga(2 time nationalist ) and Cycling(rode a 55km in single go)

            <p class="para">
                I builded a machine learning model to recognise the faces from the existing face-data;
                Due to pandemic everyone wear a mask.so, I did few modifications to my model so that it can recognise the faces even while wearing the mask;
                I used the below technologies and techniques

             We desinged and implemented a DBMS to manage a restaurant using concepts of DBMS including triggers,transacitons and Normalisation.
